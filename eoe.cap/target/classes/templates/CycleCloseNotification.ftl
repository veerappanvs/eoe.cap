Dear CAP Manager,<br>
<br>
As we approach the end of the school year, we want to remind you to close any completed CAP Cycles before 8/31. It is encouraged to close all completed CAP cycles as "Completed CAP" in the current School Year, so that all the completed cycles can be reported to the State. The files and data in each cycle will be retained in the system for 3 years from the cycle start date. During this time, you will be able to log in, view, and download your files.<br>

<b>If this candidate has completed CAP cycle, please close this cycle within the next 30 days.</b><br>
<br>
CAP cycles can be closed by the CAP Manager or Program Supervisor by taking the following steps:<br>

<ol>
<li>
<a href="https://gateway.edu.state.ma.us/edu/myportal/meoe" target="_blank" >Log in</a> to the CAP Online Platform.
</li>

<li>
Open a candidate's CAP cycle page.
</li>

<li>
Select "CAP Form" from the left-hand menu.
</li>

<li>
Scroll down to "Cycle Status" section and click "Do you want to end Cycle?"
</li>
<li>
Select a reason for closing the cycle.
</li>

</ol>
Note:&nbsp;&nbsp;If you select the "Completed CAP" as the reason, please review and confirm all required forms are completed.<br>
